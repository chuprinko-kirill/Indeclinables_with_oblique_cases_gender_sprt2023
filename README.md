# Indeclinables with oblique cases gender sprt 2023

This repository contains files necessary for conducting a self-paced reading task experiment we designed the Spring 2023. The data analysis code is also presented. The experiment was ran on the [*PennController for IBEX*](https://www.pcibex.net/) platform. Some premade templates and scripts were used. The modified sripts and custom environment for the platform are placed in this repository. 
   
The data analysis was conducted with the R programming language. The report is presented as Quatro document rendered as an html page. [The available page is hosted via Github pages](https://chuprinko-kirill.github.io/Indeclinables_with_oblique_cases_gender_sprt2023/indeclinables_in_obl_gender_sprt.html). The gathered dataset is not provided.

***The experiment description***
 
Contemporary Russian has a small group of indeclinable nouns ending with vowels untrivial for the nominative flexion, e.g. ***-u*** and ***-e***. Some indeclinables have a significant within inter and intraspeaker gender variation. In some cases similarity of a final vowel to the nominative ending or regular nouns plays the role. For instance, the indeclinables wit ***-a*** final vowel prone to be feminine.

In this experiment we aim to estimate whether final vowels' similarity to the flexions of cases other than nominative can facilitate sentence processing with various gender agreement. More precisely, we are interested whether the ***-u*** and **-e*** nouns in the accusative and dative cases contexts respectively are processed faster with feminine agreement than with masculine or neuter.

In order to check it we made two sets of stimuli like in the examples below and conducted a classic self-paced reading task for online RT measurement and grammaticality judgement tasks for the offline processing.

- На ветке мы увидели какаду, сверкающую / сверкающего своим ярким оперением.
